<H1>Fuller Description of Hobbies:</H1>
<H5>Coding</H5>
I have been coding for about 7 years. I started coding when<br>
I was in high school. I coded first as a beginner on a team. Then, I moved <br>
to a point where I started my own GitHub profile and began coding on my own. <br>
I have improved a lot over the years. But one thing remains the same, my love <br>
of coding.
