<H5>Playing Trumpet</H5>
I have been playing trumpet for about 7 years. I started playing trumpet when<br>
I was in middle school. I played in beginner band and jazz band. Then, I moved <br>
onto high school where I joined marching band and wind ensemble. I have improved <br>
significantly over the years, but one thing remains the same, my love for the instrument.
